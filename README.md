# DragToScroll
A modification of a DragToScroll AutoHotKey script.

Original script allowed to pan the canvass in any application that would allow it by clicking a mouse button.  
By default, that is a right mouse button, and for quite a few reasons, it is most convenient as well.  
However, the script would override   
(1) browser gestures and   
(2) right-click-and-drag actions in Windows explorer.  

These concerns prompted the modification of the original script.  
Commit history reflects all pertinent changes.
